# Formula1 (Statistically) Who is the GOAT?

![F1DataScience](F1DataSciencelegacy.png)Statistics and Deep Learning analysis of F1 races, results, Recency Bias
This notebook examines how changes to Formula 1’s points system have introduced a structural recency bias when comparing driver or team performance across eras. Since 1950, both the value of a race win and the number of point-scoring opportunities have steadily increased, with major inflection points in 2010 (25-point wins), 2019 (fastest-lap points), and 2021 (sprint races). As a result, a driver could earn a maximum of 9 points in a 1950 race weekend, compared to up to 34 points in 2024. The analysis documents these rule changes and provides a framework for adjusting historical results to enable fair, era-normalized comparisons.
